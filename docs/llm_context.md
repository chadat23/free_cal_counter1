# App usage summary

FreeCal Counter is to help people track calories, macros, and weight over time. 

At a high level, eventually, it should be able to do things like track calories, fat, carbs, and protein per meal, day, and week, enable visualizing, easy data entry and editing from sources such as the FDA as well as OpenFoodFacts (OFF). There should be a local db (perced and pruined from FDA data) to search, a local db of logged foods to expidite reselecting foods, and the ability to reach out to OFF as well. Local stuff should be prioritised since it's faster, but other than that basic workflow divergence, any source should seemlessly integrated. It should also be able to track and visualize a person's weight over time, and to make recomendations regarding macro nutrient targets. While the goal isn't infinite flexibility or to allow any work flow, it needs to be flexible, we always want it to be easy for users to fix input mistakes.
